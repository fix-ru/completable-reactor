Completable Reactor implementation details

=== Graph representation
There are four scopes of classes that express Graph:

* DSL - public language specific API that developers use to build Graphs. +
[code]
----
ru.fix.completable.reactor.graph.Vertex +
ru.fix.completable.reactor.graph.Graph

class MyGraph: Graph<MyPayload>{
    ...
    val myVertex = handler{...}.withMerger{...}
    ...
    myVertex.on(...).handleBy(...)
    ...
}

----

* Runtime - stores graph configuration in runtime.
CompletabelReactor executes DSL and creates runtime graph instances during application initialization.
[code]
----
ru.fix.completable.reactor.graph.runtime.RuntimeGraph +
ru.fix.completable.reactor.graph.runtime.RuntimeVertex
----

* Execution - for each Payload submission CompletableReactor reads Runtime graph description `RuntimeGraph`and builds Execution representation.
Execution representation of the graph is a brunch of CompletableFutures linked with each other.

* Compile - functionality that represent Graph during visualization.
Parser analyzes source code of Graph and builds graph model.
This model is displayed by viewer as visual representation.

=== Execution Process
Each invocation of Completable Reactor triggers execution process that consists of three parts.

* Read graph runtime description `RuntimeGraph/RuntimeVertices`
* Build CompletableFuture chain that implements given Graph
* Execute CompletableFuture chain

[code]
----
ru.fix.completable.reactor.runtime.execution.ExecutionBuilder
----
is responsible for building CompletableFuture chain.
Intermediate representation of CompletableFuture chain is a graph of Processing Vertices.
Processing Vertex Graph is a temporal structure that stores CompletableFutures.
Each ProcessingVertex (pvx) in Processing Vertex Graph is linked with RuntimeVertex (vx).
Tree of Runtime Vertices (vx) is build by DSL and represents graph structure.
Tree of runtime graph is immutable.
Tree of Processing Vertexes (pvx) represents execution graph.
Runtime builds execution graph each time when payload submitted to ReactorGraph.

Processing Vertex keeps references to CompletableFutures.
CompletableFutures represent incoming or outgoing transitions and result of computation particular elements of a vertex: handlers.

All types of Vertices in runtime represents as a Processing Vertex with handler and merger.
Router is a Processing Vertex with empty merger.
Mutator is a router with no result.


=== How to build
There is no task that builds Intellij Idea plugin.
Use Intellij Idea IDE UI to create plugin release.
Intellij plugin located at `completable-reactor-plugin-idea` directory.
In order to open plugin module into Intellij Idea you have to manually add line
[code,xml]
----
<module fileurl="file://$PROJECT_DIR$/completable-reactor-plugin-idea/completable-reactor-plugin-idea.iml" filepath="$PROJECT_DIR$/completable-reactor-plugin-idea/completable-reactor-plugin-idea.iml" />
----

into `.idea/modules.xml` configuration file.
