Completable Reactor implementation details

=== Graph representation
There are four scopes of classes that express Graph:

* DSL - public language specific API that developers use to build Graphs. +
[code]
----
ru.fix.completable.reactor.graph.Vertex +
ru.fix.completable.reactor.graph.Graph

class MyGraph: Graph<MyPayload>{
    ...
    val myVertex = handler{...}.withMerger{...}
    ...
    myVertex.on(...).handleBy(...)
    ...
}

----

* Runtime - stores graph configuration in runtime.
CompletabelReactor executes DSL and creates runtime graph instances during application initialization.
[code]
----
ru.fix.completable.reactor.graph.runtime.RuntimeGraph +
ru.fix.completable.reactor.graph.runtime.RuntimeVertex
----

* Execution - for each Payload submission CompletableReactor reads Runtime graph description `RuntimeGraph`and builds Execution representation.
Execution representation of the graph is a brunch of CompletableFutures linked with each other.

* Compile - functionality that represent Graph during visualization.
Parser analyzes source code of Graph and builds graph model.
This model is displayed by viewer as visual representation.

=== How to build
There is no task that builds Intellij Idea plugin.
Use Intellij Idea IDE UI to create plugin release.
Intellij plugin located at `completable-reactor-plugin-idea` directory.
In order to open plugin module into Intellij Idea you have to manually add line
[code,xml]
----
<module fileurl="file://$PROJECT_DIR$/completable-reactor-plugin-idea/completable-reactor-plugin-idea.iml" filepath="$PROJECT_DIR$/completable-reactor-plugin-idea/completable-reactor-plugin-idea.iml" />
----

into `.idea/modules.xml` configuration file.

=== Generate documentation
Documentation source located at
----
asciidoc/*
----
Compiled documentation stored at
----
docs/*
----
Compiled documentation stored in git and served as a static content.
To compile documentation run
----
gradle asciidoctor
