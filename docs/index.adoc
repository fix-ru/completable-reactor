[abstract]
CompletableReactor framework makes it easier to create business flows that have concurrently running parts and complex execution branching.

CompletableReactor provides DSL-like builder-style API to describe business flows and visualization plugins
that parse code and displays it as an execution graph.
CompletableReactor follows code-first approach when developer writes code and IDE visualizes it in plugin window and provides ability to navigate from graph to code and backward.

Framework built on top of Fork Join Pool and CompletableFuture API.
Different JVM based languages use extension to support more suitable DSL-like API.
Currently supported DSLs are for `Java` and `Kotlin` languages.

== Motivation
link:https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/CompletableFuture.html[CompletableFuture API]
with link:https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/ForkJoinPool.html[ForkJoinPool]
provides ability to write asynchronous code. But sometimes business logic not as straight forward as we would like.
This leads to complex `thenApply`/`thenCompose` CompletableFuture chains that hard to read and maintain. Kotlin
link:https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines.html[`suspend` methods and coroutines]
slightly simplifies sequential chains, but they are still fail to clarify complexity of
unobvious conditional branching with scenarios executed in parallel.

Complex business logic with lots of branching and concurrently executing parts hard to describe using regular coding
 approach without proper visualization. One of ways to represent that branching is a graph with nodes and
 transitions.
CompletableReactor API tries to keep API as simple and possible, saves benefits of statically typed languages and in
same time provides ability for fast code parsing and visualization as a graph of execution flows.

=== Write simple graph application
In given example flight ticket purchase process implemented as a reactor graph.
Payload contains request, response and intermediate data for computation.
[source,java]
----
class BuyFightTicketPayload {
    class Request {
        String destination;
        String name;
        Integer age;
    }
    class IntermediateData {
        BigDecimal price;
    }
    class Response {
        String operationResult;
    }
    final Request request = new Request();
    final IntermediateData intermediateData = new IntermediateData();
    final Response response = new Response();
}
----

All graph classes extends base `Graph<Payload>`

[source,java]
----

                    payload -> emailClient.sendEmail("Congratulations, you have purchased a ticket.")
            ).withoutMerger();

    //
    // To build graph we join vertices with transitions.
    // Some transitions could be conditional.
    //
    {
        payload()
                .handleBy(askForPrice)
                .handleBy(reserveSeat);

        reserveSeat
                .on(Flow.DENY_PURCHASE).complete()
                .on(Flow.SEAT_RESERVED).mergeBy(askForPrice);

SalesDepartment: calculate current price for New York

==== View visual representation of the Graph
* Display visual graph directly from code by `Ctrl+R` shortcut `(Tools->ReactorGraph)`
* Navigate from graph to code by double-clicking on the nodes
* Read graph description in nodes menu generated directly from code comments

==== Monitor graph execution
* Monitor graph and individual vertex performance
* Trace how graph execute through individual vertex by enabling tracing for particular payloads
* Check reactor reports about vertices that executed too long, did not complete on timeout or hang


== Completable Reactor model
Describes concept behind CompletbleReactor.
Explains how we can decompose concurrent conditional execution into base graph components.
Describes how reactor components could be described in code and how they visualized.

[Completable Reactor model](docs/completable-reactor-model/completable-reactor-model.md)


## Validation

During ReactorGraph building process CompletableReactorBuilder apply validation procedures on ReactorGraph instance. Validators checks
that graph is consistent, have complete nodes and correct transitions etc.

## Intellij Idea Plugin
https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/9599-completable-reactor

Completable Reactor Intellij Idea plugin provides graph visualization and source code navigation within IDE.
You can jump to code using double click on graph item or context menu.
